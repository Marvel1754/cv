# CV
## This is a test for my CV

___
"___" is a horizontal line

#### The number of hashtags represents the level of heading as follows
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5 
###### and so on...

_Single underscore or asterisk before and after the text italicizes it._

__Double underscores or asterisks before and after the text boldens it__

---

- A single hyphen and a space creates a list bullet point
* A single asterisk does the same
  * Two spaces, an asterisk, and then another space creates a sublist
    * And so on and so forth
    * This was done manually because the IDE created the needed "pre-spaces" automatically

`A single backtick surrounding the text creates this. Returns are not recognized withing this`
